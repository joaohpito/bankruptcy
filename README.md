# Summary
- Using the bankruptcy dataset develop classification machine learning models
- Using Python â€“ Compare at least three models and demonstrate which of the models predict the data 
better using the evaluation metrics
- Comment on your overall results, including the effect of the 
coefficients and/or important features on your target 
variable

# Goal

- Given the risk of bankruptcy, what KPIs to look at when choosing a company to invest in? Since we are looking through the lens of an investor, our aim is to maximize recall (True Positives) whereas precision is not relevant (97% of the companies have not gone bankrupt)
- Chosen models: Random Forest, Decision Tree and Gradient Boo
